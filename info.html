  </ul>
  <h3 class="centeredCompletely"><i>Next Steps</i></h3>
  <p class="centered">We will soon meet with Nick Buron, QPLâ€™s Chief Librarian, to discuss the implementation of the Culture Buddies program and its integration with the QPL website. However, that does not mean our work is done, we plan to further iterate on our design and technical prototype to better address the concerns we had for our project throughout this course, that is, we hope to engage with more vulnerable populations to truly understand the needs of those who may not have the same privileges and access as the populations we engaged with during our research process, and we also hope to find more ways to ensure that Culture Buddies is free of bias and is something that people of all cultures and backgrounds will be open to using.

  <p class="centered">We would firstly like to thank our mentor, Laura Kurgan, for advising us through the duration of our entire project, helping us get valuable data and connections to aid with our research and engagement process, and providing us with feedback that really influenced a lot of our design decisions.<br><br>We would also like to thank Nick Buron for taking the time to discuss the possibility of turning our prototypes into a reality.<br><br>We want to thank the other PIT instructors, Lydia Chilton, Mark Hansen, and Celeste Layne, for creating the PIT Double Diamond design process, using critical questions to help guide us through our public interest technology project.<br><br>Finally, we would like to thank all of our classmates along with our TAs, Anne-Laure Razat and Stacy Tao, for always providing us with incredible feedback, much of which helped influence our design decisions.<br><br>We learned a lot through this process, and none of it would have been possible without all of your help.
